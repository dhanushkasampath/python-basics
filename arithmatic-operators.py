# Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.
squared = 7 ** 2 # This is not supported in java
cubed = 2 ** 3
print(squared)
print(cubed)

# Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:
lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10
print(lotsofhellos)

# Lists can be joined with the addition operators:
even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)
